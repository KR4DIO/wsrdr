DATES

All dates are UTC, i.e. YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (just happens to be the form used by
sqlite3, which I use to store the data).


RECORD RANGE

Record ranges are specified using decimal numbers from 0 to 4080 that follow the
general patter start:end. The allowable variances are (using s and e to
represent start and end):

    s       - a single record number
    s:      - all records starting at s
    :e      - all records between 0 and e


MEMORY LOCATION RANGES

These are specified in the same way as record ranges except the numbers used
are be hexidecimal.


PRINT SPECIFICATION

Output of weatherstation records (not the header) can be formatted using the
-p switch and providing a string argument containing the field order. The
string is made up of one or more of:

    a.... the device memory address (in hex)
    h.... humidity outside
    H.... humidity inside
    t.... temperature outside
    T.... temperature inside
    r.... rain meter reading
    R.... rain meter difference from previous
    p.... pressure
    w.... wind speed
    g.... gust speed
    d.... wind direction
    i.... record interval (time since previous save in mins)
    u.... date/time of the data as utc
    U.... as u but with the value enclosed in ''s

e.g.
    $ ./wsrdr -r 1:20 -p "uhtpwd"

lists the date/time, humidity outside, temp outside, pressure, wind speed and
direction. The list is separated by the separator string declared using the
-S switch (e.g. -S "; ", -S "-"). If ommited, as in the example, the default
separator is ",".
